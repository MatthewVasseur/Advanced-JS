#### Submitting homework

Homework that needs to be submitted will be in the following way:

- Fork this repo
- Create a folder for yourself called firstname.lastname
- In that folder, create a hwX folder, corresponding to the week (ie hw1)
- Put your code there
- Commit, and push
- First time only: email rafi@hackyale.com a link to your repo.

If you don't know how to use git, take the time to learn about it! If you're really stuck, then just email your `hw1` folder as a zip file.
